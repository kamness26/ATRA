      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>ATRA Social Engine</strong>
      (“<strong>ATRA</strong>”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares
      information when you use our software, scripts, and related services
      (collectively, the “Service”), including when the Service connects to
      third-party platforms such as TikTok and other social networks through
      their developer APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do
      not use the Service.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <p>Depending on how you use the Service, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account details</strong> you provide, such as your name,
        username/handle, and contact information (for example, email address).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content and metadata</strong> that you submit or generate
        through the Service, such as videos, titles, captions, and scheduling
        data for posts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support communications</strong> that you send to us, including
        bug reports, feedback, or questions about the Service.

    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Information from Connected Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      When you authorize the Service to connect to third-party platforms (such
      as TikTok), we may receive certain information from those platforms,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account identifiers</strong> (for example, your TikTok user ID,
        channel ID, or page ID).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access tokens and permissions</strong> that allow the Service
        to act on your behalf according to the scope of your authorization
        (for example, uploading videos or managing posts).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics and performance data</strong> for posts created or
        managed via the Service (for example, views, likes, comments, or
        engagement metrics), where permitted by the third-party platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The exact information we receive depends on the platform’s API and the
      permissions you grant when connecting your account. We do not control
      the privacy practices of those platforms and encourage you to review
      their privacy policies.
